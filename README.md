# Smart Cab Project
In this projec, we create a reinforcement learning based car, which navigates through a source and destination in a city grid. Q-Learning has been used for the car to learn in an environment where the traffic is composed of other vehicles driving in the city grid. The car follows US Driving Laws and the violations are minimised.
